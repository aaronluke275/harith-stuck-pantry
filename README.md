# harith-stuck-pantry
A game that's inspired from a friend that experienced unfortunate time of events.

If anyone has discovered this out of the blue, feel free to explore my game code.
Comming from a novice developer, this respitory is just for me to look at my progress
and I am currently not looking for anymore volunteering programmers. 
I might consider some art but at the moment, I will work what I have for now as
I am trying to focus on the game's mechanics before the graphics come into play.
